## Project: 3D object recognition
The recognition of 3D objects has been widely studied during the last decade. Its
applications are various including medical imaging, virtual reality, face detection, cultural
heritage, and quality control. The principle is to recognize 3D objects based on their shapes
properties extracted by the mean of a shape descriptor. The recognition process has three
major steps. The first step is the computation of descriptors, which can be global, local,
structural, transform-based, or views-based. The second step is the similarity measure,
which can be distance-based, probability-based, or graph-based. A decision making
process is performed in the third step in order to classify the 3D objects according to the
used similarity measure, and it can be hard, or soft. The aim of this project is to design and
to develop a deep learning model for the recognition of 3D object, without referring to
machine learning concept. This can be performed by converting the 3D object into a
volumetric representation of multiple slices and applying the principles of CNN or RNN.
